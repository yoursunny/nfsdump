	Several fixes:

	1.  The format for read responses (v3) was missing the "count"
		before the actual number.

	2.  The info printed for write requests (v3) was truncated, so
		the count (and following info) was lost.

	3.  Fixed numerous problems in the v2 protocol, where field
		names were missing.  This will require massive changes
		in the parsing of v2 requests/responses.

	Changed "FROM" and "TO" in the v3 rename to the usual syntax.
	Removed extra keywords (redundancies).

	Many small changes (see fixer2.pl) and fixed the fn in rename
	(which was being given as a fh-- oops!).  This might cause
	problems:  it will need to be checked carefully everywhere the
	conversion is done.
