README for nfsdump version 1.2.0a, dated 3/12/2007.

This is an ALPHA release!

- It has not been tested on many platforms.

- Some new functionality has not been tested for correctness.

Please double-check the results carefully and let me know if you have
any problems.

NEW FEATURES:

1.2.0:

	1.  Cleaned up portability problems (constructs flagged by
		-Wall, -pedantic).  Changed to use standard libraries
		in a few places.  Removed dead code no longer
		referenced.

		3/12/2007:  These changes are not believed to make any
		noticeable difference.

	2.  Added functionality to decode and print the contents of
		READDIR3 and READDIRP3 responses. 

		3/12/2007:  THIS FUNCTIONALITY IS STILL LARGELY
		UNTESTED FOR READDIRP3.  Your assistance in checking
		that it actually works on your platform is
		appreciated.

	3.  Added functionality to proper anonymize the contents of
		READDIR3 and READDIRP3 responses.

	4.  Changed the anonymizer to anonymize fileid's, since on
		some systems this is simply the inode number.
